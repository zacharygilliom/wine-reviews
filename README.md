# wine-reviews

Wine tasting can be a very subjective experience.  Someone who is very new to wine tasting is probably no going to have the same appreciation for subtle tastes as someone who has done a lot more wine tasting.  So I tried to focus on wine tasters who had a lot of reviews as there opinions would most likely be more accurate of the general opinion.

I also wanted to take a look at the countries that had the most reviews as they would have a better gauge on which countries had the best wine.

It's important to take a look at some of the unique values too.  Are a lot of our reviews spread out over a wide area?  Are they very specific to a specific type of wine?  How many different wine tasters participated?
